# DMOTE-78-key
I liked the interesting thumb cluster of the [DMOTE keyboard](https://github.com/veikman/dactyl-keyboard/tree/master) and had played around with trying to add some tenting to it. Then I found the [Dactyl Flex](https://kbd.news/Threaded-Dactyl-Flex-1409.html) and liked the open frame and screw adjustable tenting.

So I set out to combine the two, I ended up rebuilding every single part except the key deck (from the Dactyl Flex), and the position of the thumb keys (from the DMOTE).
If I were to build another one I have some changes I would make as well. This was all hand modeled in blender, as I am not a programer and I have very low cad skills.
